I needed a program to save me time while working on GNOME extensions so I made this. I use a [makefile](https://github.com/julio641742/extend-panel-menu/blob/4fa4e4fb6b87c81e38dfd83c1d9efe41cfb2dd08/Makefile) to build my extensions, hence the command feature.

Features:
- enable / disable / remove extension by UUID
- list extensions
- Sends a test system notification
- run a terminal command
- Restarts GNOME (X11 only)


run
`gjs testinator.js`
